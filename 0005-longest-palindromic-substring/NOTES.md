This code implements a solution to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string using a recursive approach.
​
The longestPalindrome method takes a string s as input and returns the longest palindromic substring found in s. It initializes two variables, start and length, with -1 and 0, respectively. These variables are used to keep track of the starting index and length of the longest palindromic substring found so far.
​
The method then calls the explore method, passing in the character array of the input string, the index of the middle character, which is s.length() / 2, and a direction of 0. The explore method is responsible for finding the longest palindromic substring centered around a given index.
​
The explore method takes three parameters: the character array of the input string, the index of the center character, and the direction of exploration. It first initializes two pointers, i and j, to the left and right of the center character, respectively. It then expands these pointers to both sides as long as the characters match, thereby finding the boundaries of the palindromic substring centered around the center character.
​
After finding the boundaries, the method expands both pointers to both sides until the characters no longer match. This gives the longest palindromic substring centered around the center character. If this substring is longer than the longest palindromic substring found so far, the start and length variables are updated accordingly.
​
Finally, if the direction of exploration is not 2 and the substring to the left of the center character could possibly contain a longer palindrome than the longest palindrome found so far, the method recursively calls itself with the new center index and direction of 1. Similarly, if the direction of exploration is not 1 and the substring to the right of the center character could possibly contain a longer palindrome than the longest palindrome found so far, the method recursively calls itself with the new center index and direction of 2.
​
This recursive approach is used to explore all possible center indices of palindromic substrings in the input string, and the start and length variables are updated with the longest palindromic substring found. Finally, the method returns the longest palindromic substring found or null if no palindromic substring is found.
