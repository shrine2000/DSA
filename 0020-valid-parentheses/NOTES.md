The given code checks whether a given string s containing brackets (round, square, and curly) is valid or not, based on the following rules:
​
An opening bracket must be closed by a corresponding closing bracket of the same type.
Brackets must be closed in the correct order.
The approach used in the code is to use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets that have not been closed yet.
​
The code iterates over each character ch in the input string s. If ch is an opening bracket (i.e., '(' or '[' or '{'), then it is added to the top of the stack. If ch is a closing bracket (i.e., ')' or ']' or '}'), then the top of the stack is checked to see if it is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is, then the opening bracket is popped off the stack and the iteration continues. If it is not, then the string is invalid, and the code returns false.
​
After the iteration is complete, the code checks if the stack is empty. If it is, then all opening brackets have been closed, and the string is valid. If it is not empty, then there are some opening brackets that have not been closed, and the string is invalid.
​
Overall, the approach used in the code is simple and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
