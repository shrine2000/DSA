This implementation uses the bit manipulation approach to generate all possible subsets of the given array nums in the form of binary numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1. The ith bit of the binary representation of a number i determines whether the corresponding element of nums should be included in the subset. The time complexity of this approach is O(n * 2^n), which is the best possible time complexity as there are 2^n subsets and each element can be present or absent in a subset. The space complexity is also O(n * 2^n) as there are 2^n subsets and each subset can have up to n elements.
