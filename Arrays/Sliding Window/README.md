```python

    result = ...

        # 1. Expand the window by including the element at the 'right' pointer
        add_element_to_window_state(window_state, data[right])

        # 2. Process the window and update the result if necessary
        # This step often involves checking if the current window satisfies the problem's condition
        update_result(result, window_state, left, right)
