The line n >>= 1 shifts all bits of the integer n to the right by one position. This is equivalent to dividing n by 2 and discarding any remainder.

This operation is also known as a right shift operation. During the shift, the leftmost bit (also known as the sign bit) is preserved, and the rightmost bit is discarded. A new bit is added to the leftmost position, and its value is determined by the value of the sign bit.

For example, if n is 6, its binary representation is 110 (or 0b110 in Java). After the right shift operation n >>= 1, the value of n will be 3, which has a binary representation of 011 (or 0b011 in Java).

In the context of this specific problem, the right shift operation is used to move through each bit of the binary representation of n. By repeatedly shifting n to the right, the next least significant bit becomes the rightmost bit, which can be checked using the bitwise AND operator n & 1.
