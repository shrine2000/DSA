First, the method checks if the head node is None or the list has only one node. In these cases, there can't be a cycle, so it returns None.
​
The method initializes two pointers, slow and fast, to the head node, and a boolean variable has_cycle to False to keep track of whether a cycle is detected.
​
The method uses a while loop to move the fast pointer two steps ahead and the slow pointer one step ahead in each iteration. If there is a cycle in the list, the fast pointer will eventually catch up with the slow pointer.
​
Inside the loop, the method checks if the slow pointer and fast pointer meet. If they meet, it means there is a cycle in the list, and the has_cycle variable is set to True. The loop is then exited.
​
After the loop, the method checks the value of the has_cycle variable. If it is False, it means the fast pointer reached the end of the list, and there is no cycle. In this case, it returns None.
​
If has_cycle is True, the method moves one pointer (slow) back to the head of the list and keeps the other pointer (fast) at the meeting point of the two pointers.
​
After detecting that there is a cycle in the list, the method sets one pointer (`slow`) back to the head of the list and keeps the other pointer (`fast`) at the meeting point of the two pointers where they intersected.
​
By moving both pointers at the same pace (one step at a time) until they meet again, they will eventually reach the node at which the cycle begins. This is because the distance between the head node and the start of the cycle is the same as the distance between the meeting point and the start of the cycle.
​
Therefore, by moving one pointer back to the head and the other pointer from the meeting point, they will meet at the start of the cycle. This approach leverages the mathematical concept known as the "Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm" or "tortoise and hare algorithm."
​
Once the pointers meet again, the method returns the node at which they meet, which is the start of the cycle.
​
The code snippet ensures that the `slow` pointer and `fast` pointer are moved in tandem until they meet, guaranteeing that the start of the cycle is identified correctly.
