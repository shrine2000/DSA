### Identifying pattern 

| When to Use BFS              | When to Use DFS                |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Finding shortest path        | Exploring all possibilities    |
| Minimum steps to reach target| Backtracking                   |
| Level-order traversal        | Detecting cycles               |
| Connected components         | Topological sorting            |
| Optimality in unweighted graphs | Memory efficiency (less memory usage) |


**BFS Patterns:**
   - Look for keywords like "shortest path," "minimum steps," "level-order traversal," "connected components," or problems involving optimality in unweighted graphs.

**DFS Patterns:**
   - Keywords indicating DFS usage include "exploring all possibilities," "backtracking," "cycle detection," or problems where memory efficiency is a concern.
